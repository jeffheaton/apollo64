Apollo64 BBS for the Commodore 64
=================================

![MergeLife](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffheaton/apollo64/master/apollo64.png)

This is a [BBS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) that I wrote back in 1989 when I was in [high school](https://www.lhssstl.org/page).  This was to run the Mission Control BBS in area code 314, it still appears on a few [old BBS lists](http://happy.kiev.ua/pub/nodelist/old/nodelist/1990/nodelist.313).  The BBS is written about half in [CBM basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC) and half in [6510 assembly code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510) for speed. It was never a widely used system, maybe a handful of systems in the 314.  I did find two working .D64 image files of it on the net, I believe from another 314 area BBS.  All are included here.  

Probably not of much use in this day and age, but this was one of my earliest attempts at programming.  I do not miss line-number BASIC one bit!
