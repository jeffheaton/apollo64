Apollo64 BBS for the Commodore 64
=================================

This is a [BBS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) that I wrote back in the late 1980s.  This was to run the Mission Control BBS in area code 314, it still appears on a few [old BBS lists](http://happy.kiev.ua/pub/nodelist/old/nodelist/1990/nodelist.313).  The BBS is written about half in [CBM basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC) and half in [6510 assembly code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510) for speed. It spread from my Mission Control BBS to a number of other systems. This system was useful because it provided many of the features available in the Color 64 BBS system, but did not require a [1764 RAM Expansion Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_REU).

I did find two working .D64 image files of it on the net, I believe from another 314 area BBS.  All are included here.  

Probably not of much use in this day and age, but this was one of my earliest attempts at a decent length program.  I do not miss line-number BASIC one bit!
